The attacks associated with the new botnet attempted to exploit the CVE-2017-17215 zero-day vulnerability in the Huawei home router caused by the fact that the TR-064 technical report standard, which was designed for local network configuration, was exposed to WAN through port 37215 (UPnP – Universal Plug and Play).
About 12 hours ago (2017-12-05 11:57 AM GMT+8), we noticed a new version of Satori (a mirai variant which we named Satori), starting to propagate very quickly on port 37215 and 52869.
Two new exploits, which work on port 37215 and 52869 have been added, see below for more details.
Due to the worm like behavior, we all should be on the lookout for the port 37215 and 52869 scan traffic.
For those who don’t have the visibility, feel free to check out our free Scanmon system for port 37215 and 52869, or ISC port pages for 37215 and 52869.
As can be seen from the following picture, the bot will scan port 37215 and 52869 randomly, determined by the remainder of a random integer mod 3.
During the scanning, Satori will utilize two different exploits, one on port 37215, while the other on 52869.
The one on port 37215 is not fully disclosed yet, our team has been tracking this in the last few days and got quite some insight, but we will not discuss it here right now.(stay tuned for our update later).
For example, during last recent 12 hours we have seen 263,250 different IPs scanning port 37215, and 19,403 IPs scanning port 52869.
On February 8th, 2018, Radware’s Deception Network detected a significant increase in malicious activity over port 8080. Further investigation uncovered a new variant of the Satori botnet capable of aggressive scanning and exploitation of CVE-2017-18046 – Dasan Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution. Referred to as “Satori.Dasan,” it’s been rapidly expanding with a high success rate. The C2/Exploit server for this botnet is 185.62.188.88 (AS49349 – BlazingFast LLC, Ukraine)

A file named “LBefv2g_2Wyik” was successfully downloaded from the URL hxxp://www.monikatex[.]ru/LBefv2g_2Wyik Based on the results from “abuseipdb.com” IP address 185.186.1.131 was a Russian registered IP address.
Not long after a new strain of the Akuma malware was discovered targeting ZyXEL devices with a new series of login/password attacks, FortiGuard Labs last week also began detecting strange scanning activities on uncommon TCP ports 52869 and 37215. We and other threat research teams quickly began to suspect that these were tied together, and that there was a new botnet out there.
The new variant spotted by Trend Micro implements the same features as previous ones, it targets TCP ports 9527 and 34567, a circumstance that suggests its operators aim to target IP cameras and DVRs. 
The Wicked Mirai would scan ports 8080, 8443, 80, and 81 by initiating a raw socket SYN connection to IoT devices. Once it has established a connection, the bot will attempt to exploit the device and download its payload by writing the exploit strings to the socket through the write() syscall.
